# Cypress Dojo Project Template

## Getting Started

-   After cloning the project start by installing the necessary dependencies via

```bash
npm install
```

-   You can verify that your app is working by running the following and navigating to localhost:5000

```bash
npm start
```

-   There are the default Cypress examples in the /cypress/integration/examples directory. These should give you a good starting point for learning how to write tests. You can also check the [docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell) for answers to your questions.

-   The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Qujo8XSH5Fzd0w9kwyHDuM2hXI3szFtJTkHjnXiFn08/edit?usp=sharing) for this dojo have the test scenarios. If you get stuck there is my version of the tests in /cypress/integration/formtests/form-answers.spec.ts but you should try to work through them on your own first.

-   Once you are ready to try out your tests you can run cypress via

```bash
npm test
```
